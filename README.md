# Ingredients To Dishes

Hungry? Have Apples, Oranges, Bananas? Not sure what to do with them?Well I got you covered! :D 

As Ichinose Hakka once said, "If Hakka lives until she's 100, that's (365 x 3) x 100 = 109500. That's only 109,500 meals!! I have to choose them wisely!!" Making the best out of the current situation is what life is all about. So why not apply that same logic on food that we eat?

This android application is designed to try and search recipes from various recipe sites and return to you with recipes that you can potentially make. It allows user to pick the ingredients and find relevant recipes through the Food2Fork API. Through the API, it provides the ingredients list, a sample picture of the food, and the source url for instructions on how to make the food. Since the API uses multiple sites, it puts the burden on the user to visit the site for the directions in making the food.
